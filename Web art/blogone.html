        I found it hard to stay concentrated throughout the entire video
        especially because I was failing to understand most of what was being
        said. I resorted to taking breaks in between the videos in order for me
        to grasp the information I will have to go over the videos several times
        again because a lot was said.

        When it comes to net web art nothing about it fascinates me at all, I
        understand that it is an art that is solely based on and functions
        through the web and is nothing like traditional art that can be uploaded
        onto the web but does not rely on it. But I fail to see its purpose or
        even the beauty in it. But what I did find interesting was Kyle
        McDonald’s <b>Exhausting a Crowd</b>

      <p>
        the interactivity that comes along with it is what’s interesting the
        fact that the user can interact with the work is what I liked about it
        and there is beauty in the recordings of everyday life, and it is
        somewhat very immersive to just watch. Nothing else was as fascinating
        to me I thought I would see more arts that are aesthetically pleasing
        but none of them were appealing to look at or piqued my interest much. I
        hated how some of the artworks incorporated a lot of writing.

        Maybe I lack the sense of understanding of what the purpose of net web
        art is and therefore I don’t see the beauty in it or if there is any
        purpose to it at all. I particularly enjoyed the Danae reading which
        gave a broader explanation of net web art I started to understand more
        what is being referred to using the term “net web art”. The readings
        were easy to read and understand which is what I resonate with most
        about them.

        In the reading
        <b
          >Park Design Principles for Interactive user experience through net
          art</b
        >
        I resonated most with the section that talked about "collaborative
        participation" which is what interests me the most when it comes to net
        art the idea of having the user actively participate in the artwork and
        blur the lines between artists/creator and the user.
